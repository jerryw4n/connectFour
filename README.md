# connectFour
This project is a web-based version of Connect Four, created as a class assignment. Includes a dynamic game board with HTML and CSS for a clear interface and JavaScript for game logic. Made for two players, enabling them to alternate turns dropping discs into columns. It also automatically checks for wins horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
